# Knowledge Graph + Obsidian RAG System for Research Papers

## Planning
- [x] Explore workspace structure and existing tools
- [x] Research technology options (Neo4j vs NetworkX, vector store, etc.)
- [x] Write implementation plan
- [x] Get user approval on plan

## Execution
- [x] Create conda environment with required packages
- [x] Build PDF ingestion pipeline (parse → chunk → embed)
- [x] Build biomedical entity/relationship extraction module
- [x] Build knowledge graph (NetworkX + persistence)
- [x] Build Obsidian-compatible markdown note generator
- [x] Build vector store (ChromaDB) for semantic search
- [x] Build RAG query engine with graph-enhanced retrieval
- [x] Build CLI interface for ingestion + querying
- [x] Create configuration and .env template

## Verification
- [x] Test full pipeline with sample PDF
- [x] Verify all module imports
- [x] Verify CLI commands work
- [x] Write walkthrough
